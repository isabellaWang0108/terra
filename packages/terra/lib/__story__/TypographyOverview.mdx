## Weight

Font weight is an important variable that adds emphasis and differentiate content hierarchy. When ranking hierarchy, choose your font weight accordingly. A bold weight represents more emphasis than a light weight font of the same size. However a lighter weight font can rank hierarchically higher if it is significantly larger than the bold font. The weight of the font will give the user clues for where to look for information.
