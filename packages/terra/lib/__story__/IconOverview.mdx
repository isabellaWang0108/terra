## Basic guide

We have several types of icons that can be used in specific contexts throughout our web and mobile products. Our icons should be:

- composed of basic shapes with a consistent style 
- recognizable, simple and schematic;
- always include a visible text label.

We are continuously polishing our icon set to make it robust enough to support all existing and future platforms.
